[00:00:00.000 - 00:00:02.760] later on and we can share the recording with others.

[00:00:02.760 - 00:00:03.840] That's awesome.

[00:00:03.840 - 00:00:06.000] Like it sounds like Aaron would be perfect to help on

[00:00:06.000 - 00:00:10.600] sort of the, well besides the manuscript also just like,

[00:00:10.600 - 00:00:13.280] the data standards and like the entry level stuff.

[00:00:13.280 - 00:00:15.680] I mean, I have other ideas too, just on that side,

[00:00:15.680 - 00:00:18.320] it was like there's making sure like,

[00:00:18.320 - 00:00:20.920] because OSDR already has all these payload records

[00:00:20.920 - 00:00:22.640] and all this biological data

[00:00:22.640 - 00:00:24.960] and all this other environmental telemetry.

[00:00:24.960 - 00:00:26.640] So making sure that the intelligence

[00:00:26.640 - 00:00:30.160] and then the data systems structure like string

[00:00:30.160 - 00:00:32.360] versus numeric, those types of questions

[00:00:32.360 - 00:00:34.280] and like the new nomenclature,

[00:00:34.280 - 00:00:35.880] making sure that all that's dialed in

[00:00:35.880 - 00:00:38.880] so that we can link it directly to all the other data.

[00:00:38.880 - 00:00:40.800] Like it would be, it would be weird

[00:00:40.800 - 00:00:43.240] to make it different than the rest of OSDR.

[00:00:43.240 - 00:00:45.680] So we can take care of a lot of that.

[00:00:45.680 - 00:00:47.960] And then yeah, Aaron Persaud,

[00:00:48.960 - 00:00:50.800] you actually read my mind on PSI

[00:00:50.800 - 00:00:55.680] because our physical science is because there's a bunch of,

[00:00:55.680 - 00:00:58.040] there's several people I'm now realizing Jessica

[00:00:58.040 - 00:01:00.800] that aren't part of the AWG that we need to pull in.

[00:01:00.800 - 00:01:04.920] The physical science is people at Marshall and Colleen.

[00:01:06.600 - 00:01:09.000] Because they started a user group,

[00:01:09.000 - 00:01:11.040] they're not calling it an AWG yet,

[00:01:11.040 - 00:01:12.280] but they're getting close.

[00:01:12.280 - 00:01:14.520] So I think in Aaron, if you have to be,

[00:01:14.520 - 00:01:17.960] it sounds like you're fluids, but there's combustion,

[00:01:17.960 - 00:01:22.960] there's cell, was that cell drop fluids here?

[00:01:23.920 - 00:01:26.880] Cell drop group, there's with all these other domains

[00:01:26.880 - 00:01:29.480] and physical sciences that we need to pull into this later on.

[00:01:29.480 - 00:01:31.360] So yeah, cool.

[00:01:31.360 - 00:01:34.080] By user group, you mean sort of on experimentation

[00:01:34.080 - 00:01:38.760] or and they're sort of getting together and meeting about.

[00:01:38.760 - 00:01:41.080] There's a physical sciences informatics.

[00:01:41.080 - 00:01:42.520] I don't know if you've heard of that before.

[00:01:42.520 - 00:01:47.600] It's sort of like the sister repository to gene lab, ALSDA,

[00:01:47.600 - 00:01:50.200] but it's purely physical sciences.

[00:01:50.200 - 00:01:55.200] They don't have quite the level of thorough data standards yet,

[00:01:55.800 - 00:01:58.040] but they do have a couple hundred data sets in there,

[00:01:58.040 - 00:02:00.960] which is great, although some of the data sets are,

[00:02:00.960 - 00:02:02.760] they're getting there, right?

[00:02:02.760 - 00:02:05.280] They're trying to standardize all of physical sciences,

[00:02:05.280 - 00:02:08.160] which is hard to say at least.

[00:02:08.160 - 00:02:12.880] So they have a user group around the data repository,

[00:02:12.880 - 00:02:16.440] which is becoming a fully fledged AWG,

[00:02:16.440 - 00:02:18.040] because they've, yeah,

[00:02:18.040 - 00:02:21.280] so we just need to pull those people into this group to help out.

[00:02:21.280 - 00:02:23.640] Yeah, because Aaron, this is a monumental task

[00:02:23.640 - 00:02:25.280] you're talking about, which is amazing

[00:02:25.280 - 00:02:28.880] if you'd be interested to support and flush out

[00:02:28.880 - 00:02:31.640] some of these records so it can get used.

[00:02:31.640 - 00:02:35.120] And I can also say that through BPS,

[00:02:35.120 - 00:02:38.000] because this project has been funded by BPS

[00:02:38.000 - 00:02:42.280] through a grant as part of the division,

[00:02:43.240 - 00:02:45.360] I have been connected with some of the physical sciences,

[00:02:45.360 - 00:02:47.000] you know, the programmatic leads,

[00:02:47.000 - 00:02:50.080] and they've gotten me two or three people at centers

[00:02:50.080 - 00:02:54.200] who are like now obliged to help out in the physical sciences.

[00:02:54.200 - 00:02:56.880] So we do have some investment,

[00:02:56.880 - 00:02:59.200] but just haven't done much in that area.

[00:02:59.200 - 00:03:03.440] So I do have names of people who've signed up to help out.

[00:03:03.440 - 00:03:07.720] So that might be something that follow up on separately

[00:03:07.720 - 00:03:11.360] and connect, yeah, maybe with Ryan and Aaron,

[00:03:11.360 - 00:03:15.640] and you guys can clue me into who I should contact on that side.

[00:03:15.680 - 00:03:18.960] I can pull in the folks who were designated by NASA

[00:03:18.960 - 00:03:20.200] to help out as well.

[00:03:20.200 - 00:03:24.160] And maybe we can just get you guys to look at the instruments

[00:03:24.160 - 00:03:26.600] that we already have and make sure that, you know,

[00:03:26.600 - 00:03:28.720] tell us what instruments we need,

[00:03:28.720 - 00:03:32.040] help us get more information on that area.

[00:03:34.760 - 00:03:35.600] Okay.

[00:03:37.480 - 00:03:39.400] Let me make sure that I'm on.

[00:03:39.400 - 00:03:41.040] You heard of TechCort, Jessica?

[00:03:41.040 - 00:03:42.040] Yes.

[00:03:42.040 - 00:03:42.880] Yes.

[00:03:42.880 - 00:03:44.840] And we have not mapped, okay, so that's another great.

[00:03:44.840 - 00:03:46.760] So now we're kind of, I'm gonna actually,

[00:03:46.760 - 00:03:48.120] I'm gonna go back to sharing my screen,

[00:03:48.120 - 00:03:50.760] because I always benefit from having something

[00:03:50.760 - 00:03:55.560] written to look at for anyone, anything's like me.

[00:03:55.560 - 00:03:59.560] So map and trees to TechCort.

[00:03:59.560 - 00:04:00.840] And I think as we've been going

[00:04:00.840 - 00:04:01.840] and every time we've been,

[00:04:01.840 - 00:04:04.840] I've gotten another list of really great suggestions

[00:04:04.840 - 00:04:07.800] of things that we should try implementing.

[00:04:09.240 - 00:04:12.960] And so we are regarding, so going back,

[00:04:12.960 - 00:04:15.840] this kind of relates to Aaron's earlier question about,

[00:04:15.840 - 00:04:18.120] like if I'm interested in a facility

[00:04:18.120 - 00:04:19.720] and wanna know like what are the experiments

[00:04:19.720 - 00:04:21.760] that I've done in there and then then how can I figure out

[00:04:21.760 - 00:04:24.640] sort of which types of experiments and like what,

[00:04:24.640 - 00:04:26.880] you know, which fluids have been looked at,

[00:04:26.880 - 00:04:29.080] that kind of thing, or what payloads have been put

[00:04:29.080 - 00:04:30.880] in that facility.

[00:04:30.880 - 00:04:33.240] So a couple of things that are,

[00:04:33.240 - 00:04:38.240] we are planning to map into OSDR anything that is already

[00:04:39.040 - 00:04:42.120] in OSDR as like a payload or as an experiment

[00:04:42.120 - 00:04:46.120] or as a data set should ultimately somehow get mapped

[00:04:46.120 - 00:04:49.320] to the hardware linked to the hardware database.

[00:04:49.320 - 00:04:51.160] So there will be linkage there

[00:04:51.160 - 00:04:54.680] that we still have to work out the structure of that linkage.

[00:04:56.200 - 00:04:58.080] And maybe if we know what kind of research questions

[00:04:58.080 - 00:05:00.600] people wanna pursue, we can make it such that

[00:05:00.600 - 00:05:03.280] you can pursue that easily without having to like,

[00:05:03.280 - 00:05:05.160] go through five different linkages to get

[00:05:05.160 - 00:05:08.600] from the hardware to the thing that was done in that hardware.

[00:05:09.200 - 00:05:12.920] And then that relates also to tech port,

[00:05:12.920 - 00:05:16.360] we will have linkages to the Space Life Sciences Library,

[00:05:16.360 - 00:05:18.760] KSC for literature, we'll have linkages to OSDR

[00:05:18.760 - 00:05:22.120] for data sets and or payloads.

[00:05:22.120 - 00:05:24.720] And then linking to tech port is great.

[00:05:24.720 - 00:05:28.360] You know, tech port entries is a great idea

[00:05:28.360 - 00:05:29.760] and maybe we just add that field,

[00:05:29.760 - 00:05:32.240] but then we need to figure out how to populate it.

[00:05:33.240 - 00:05:35.680] Or you might be mining entries from tech port,

[00:05:35.680 - 00:05:36.960] as I guess is my plan.

[00:05:36.960 - 00:05:39.080] I don't know if you necessarily need to map everything

[00:05:39.080 - 00:05:41.600] to every other database that gets for a while,

[00:05:41.600 - 00:05:43.840] but just some of this will actually,

[00:05:43.840 - 00:05:48.600] I think be content you might want to mine to.

[00:05:48.600 - 00:05:49.840] Yeah.

[00:05:49.840 - 00:05:52.080] So do, yeah.

[00:05:52.080 - 00:05:54.640] And I think, well, okay, that's something,

[00:05:54.640 - 00:05:55.920] I think I would need some help on

[00:05:55.920 - 00:05:59.800] and figuring out is there information on tech port

[00:05:59.800 - 00:06:02.960] that we, yeah, or are there entries in tech port?

[00:06:02.960 - 00:06:05.320] Yeah, what's an effective way of mining tech port

[00:06:05.320 - 00:06:07.640] for entries, especially if we are focusing

[00:06:07.640 - 00:06:09.440] quite focused on right now,

[00:06:09.440 - 00:06:11.440] just because we need to constrain scope

[00:06:11.440 - 00:06:16.440] or quite focus to instruments that have a flight history

[00:06:16.440 - 00:06:18.880] that have flown or that are flight qualified.

[00:06:18.880 - 00:06:20.360] This is what we did.

[00:06:20.360 - 00:06:25.360] If you go to tech port and you sort by TRL above seven,

[00:06:25.360 - 00:06:27.360] you get anything that's flown

[00:06:27.360 - 00:06:31.000] and that will give you access to everything that's been flown.

[00:06:31.000 - 00:06:32.760] And so that'll give you a nice list.

[00:06:32.760 - 00:06:36.760] I think our list was on the order of maybe 250 entries

[00:06:36.760 - 00:06:37.840] within this category.

[00:06:39.400 - 00:06:41.680] And then we had a bunch of metadata on top.

[00:06:42.920 - 00:06:45.960] But if you can download nice simple Excel file.

[00:06:47.560 - 00:06:48.640] That's too smart.

[00:06:48.640 - 00:06:49.640] I love it.

[00:06:49.640 - 00:06:51.840] Just so that I know the landscape though, Aaron,

[00:06:51.840 - 00:06:56.440] you, like you said, I don't want to compete, right?

[00:06:56.440 - 00:06:57.920] So if you have a database that's,

[00:06:57.920 - 00:06:59.280] you're working on a different database,

[00:06:59.280 - 00:07:02.480] hosted somewhere else on a different set of,

[00:07:02.480 - 00:07:04.840] different set of instruments or different subject matter

[00:07:04.840 - 00:07:06.400] or it's like.

[00:07:06.400 - 00:07:07.480] It'll be knee share.

[00:07:07.480 - 00:07:10.200] We focused on biomedical technologies.

[00:07:10.200 - 00:07:12.920] So we focused on biomedical.

[00:07:12.920 - 00:07:15.280] We discovered that lots is missing from tech port.

[00:07:15.280 - 00:07:16.920] Tech port is really good from like,

[00:07:16.920 - 00:07:21.520] we would say, like 2011 onward maybe,

[00:07:21.520 - 00:07:23.680] we get some good stuff,

[00:07:23.680 - 00:07:25.400] but like a lot of the historical stuff

[00:07:25.400 - 00:07:27.720] has been sort of lost, I would say.

[00:07:28.760 - 00:07:30.560] So there's a lot of like back filling

[00:07:30.560 - 00:07:32.320] that would maybe need to go.

[00:07:32.400 - 00:07:36.040] That's just my opinion, so ignore as needed.

[00:07:36.040 - 00:07:37.040] But.

[00:07:37.040 - 00:07:38.040] OK.

[00:07:38.040 - 00:07:39.040] OK.

[00:07:39.040 - 00:07:40.040] OK.

[00:07:40.040 - 00:07:41.120] And thank you.

[00:07:41.120 - 00:07:43.800] And actually biomedical is very much

[00:07:43.800 - 00:07:46.080] an area that we're not focusing on for this database.

[00:07:46.080 - 00:07:48.200] It's we're trying to do fundamental research here or stuff

[00:07:48.200 - 00:07:50.880] and mostly non-human related.

[00:07:50.880 - 00:07:53.600] Oh, Kristen, how to hand up?

[00:07:53.600 - 00:07:54.600] I did.

[00:07:54.600 - 00:07:54.800] Hi.

[00:07:54.800 - 00:07:55.320] Sorry.

[00:07:55.320 - 00:07:56.840] Tech port is relatively new to me,

[00:07:56.840 - 00:08:00.200] but I am just curious because Tech port is behind,

[00:08:00.200 - 00:08:01.920] you don't need to log in.

[00:08:01.920 - 00:08:05.320] Are we sure that everything that's there can be made?

[00:08:05.320 - 00:08:06.640] Public on this hardware?

[00:08:06.640 - 00:08:09.920] Because this hardware database will be public, right?

[00:08:09.920 - 00:08:12.280] Yes, that is another thing I forgot to introduce.

[00:08:12.280 - 00:08:14.280] Yes.

[00:08:14.280 - 00:08:17.360] I think tech port requires log in because there is some.

[00:08:18.960 - 00:08:22.040] Like tech port to me is, I think so.

[00:08:22.040 - 00:08:24.200] Most of the data in there is just technology

[00:08:24.200 - 00:08:26.280] readiness level and its date.

[00:08:26.280 - 00:08:29.200] There's not a ton of metadata associated with easy pulling

[00:08:29.200 - 00:08:30.120] from that database.

[00:08:30.120 - 00:08:31.800] It's more just like a check.

[00:08:31.800 - 00:08:33.400] I would say.

[00:08:33.400 - 00:08:34.400] OK.

[00:08:34.400 - 00:08:38.320] That's again, just my opinion.

[00:08:38.320 - 00:08:39.520] Yeah, OK.

[00:08:39.520 - 00:08:41.320] And we would have to find metadata elsewhere,

[00:08:41.320 - 00:08:44.560] but it's a great place to figure out

[00:08:44.560 - 00:08:47.840] what's TRL 7 and above in our area.

[00:08:47.840 - 00:08:50.240] OK.

[00:08:50.240 - 00:08:53.640] We're really going, so we have about 15 minutes left.

[00:08:53.640 - 00:08:55.880] And I think a great outcome of this meeting

[00:08:55.880 - 00:09:00.320] would be to have some names on things that people

[00:09:00.320 - 00:09:04.560] who are willing to take a few things forward.

[00:09:04.560 - 00:09:11.200] So any folks who are interested in the, so yes, George, go ahead.

[00:09:11.200 - 00:09:13.440] Before we go on and I kind of floated

[00:09:13.440 - 00:09:17.560] by that idea in the chat.

[00:09:17.560 - 00:09:20.200] So in terms of a database, and we're

[00:09:20.200 - 00:09:22.680] talking about the hardware, at the end of the day,

[00:09:22.680 - 00:09:25.280] the hardware will produce some data.

[00:09:25.280 - 00:09:27.440] And then that data needs to be analyzed

[00:09:27.440 - 00:09:29.720] from the analysis perspective.

[00:09:29.720 - 00:09:34.840] It's always good to figure out what kind of data formats

[00:09:34.840 - 00:09:36.360] that do the results come out.

[00:09:36.360 - 00:09:38.240] And what are the files that are generated?

[00:09:38.240 - 00:09:41.800] How can these actually be analyzed downstream?

[00:09:41.800 - 00:09:44.600] Even if you're planning an experiment ahead,

[00:09:44.600 - 00:09:47.920] you need to know, how am I going to deal with the data

[00:09:47.920 - 00:09:49.200] that comes out?

[00:09:49.200 - 00:09:51.840] And that typically is not addressed.

[00:09:51.840 - 00:09:55.400] And from the analysis perspective, you get data.

[00:09:55.400 - 00:09:57.520] And you don't know what does it represent?

[00:09:57.520 - 00:09:58.800] What's this file format?

[00:09:58.800 - 00:10:00.200] What's in the files?

[00:10:00.200 - 00:10:02.560] How do I get started with it, especially

[00:10:02.560 - 00:10:04.960] if it's a proprietary format?

[00:10:04.960 - 00:10:05.960] And things like that.

[00:10:05.960 - 00:10:08.680] So I think that would be useful information

[00:10:08.680 - 00:10:13.800] to have for all hardware that gets loaned.

[00:10:13.800 - 00:10:16.080] So that's one idea of things that

[00:10:16.080 - 00:10:18.680] can be included in the database.

[00:10:18.680 - 00:10:24.840] And then different thoughts regarding an API

[00:10:24.840 - 00:10:28.920] and actually having access to the database.

[00:10:28.920 - 00:10:31.400] And I was wondering if that's going to be in the works,

[00:10:31.400 - 00:10:38.640] or if that's going to become part of the OSDR API?

[00:10:38.640 - 00:10:41.760] This is a good question.

[00:10:41.760 - 00:10:44.280] Probably, but I need to check.

[00:10:44.280 - 00:10:49.440] I actually need to check with our OSDR folks

[00:10:49.440 - 00:10:52.360] on what the plan is.

[00:10:52.360 - 00:10:54.640] And if, and I'll bring this up,

[00:10:54.640 - 00:10:57.240] I mean, I think it makes a good sense.

[00:11:02.600 - 00:11:07.720] Just a quick question.

[00:11:07.720 - 00:11:09.480] You're the reference to answer that.

[00:11:09.480 - 00:11:11.400] Well, I'm probably not.

[00:11:11.400 - 00:11:13.840] I don't make those types of decisions.

[00:11:13.840 - 00:11:16.840] But I would also, when you have that conversation,

[00:11:16.840 - 00:11:20.080] probably if Daniel or John asked them specifically

[00:11:20.080 - 00:11:22.760] how they imagine this hardware database

[00:11:22.760 - 00:11:25.640] will be linked to either our existing hardware pages

[00:11:25.640 - 00:11:30.960] or data sets, because I wouldn't want.

[00:11:30.960 - 00:11:34.200] I think we should understand that kind of upfront.

[00:11:34.200 - 00:11:37.240] And I know that some of that will be funding specific.

[00:11:37.240 - 00:11:41.280] And I had been told that maybe they wouldn't be connected,

[00:11:41.280 - 00:11:42.680] but I would love for them to be connected.

[00:11:42.680 - 00:11:44.440] So I hope that that was incorrect.

[00:11:44.440 - 00:11:47.480] And that we can get everything as interconnected as possible,

[00:11:47.480 - 00:11:49.960] just in my benefit, the project

[00:11:49.960 - 00:11:52.720] that we get some clarification on that earlier.

[00:11:52.720 - 00:11:54.880] Yeah.

[00:11:54.880 - 00:11:57.280] Because I had this vision of everything

[00:11:57.280 - 00:12:00.040] being maximally interconnected.

[00:12:00.040 - 00:12:01.960] And I guess interconnected can mean different things.

[00:12:01.960 - 00:12:04.080] And so I think, and maybe I don't fully understand

[00:12:04.080 - 00:12:07.040] all of the different ways that things can be connected in OSDR.

[00:12:07.040 - 00:12:07.880] So you're right.

[00:12:07.880 - 00:12:08.240] Absolutely.

[00:12:08.240 - 00:12:08.760] I should.

[00:12:12.600 - 00:12:15.400] Wait, that's my answer.

[00:12:15.400 - 00:12:17.000] Okay.

[00:12:17.000 - 00:12:20.280] To clear that up for maximum usability.

[00:12:20.280 - 00:12:21.800] Yeah.

[00:12:22.800 - 00:12:24.440] Yeah, but I just didn't yell two weeks ago.

[00:12:24.440 - 00:12:28.200] This is going to be part of OSDR.

[00:12:28.200 - 00:12:28.720] Okay.

[00:12:28.720 - 00:12:31.400] So, you know, it'll be its own thing of course,

[00:12:31.400 - 00:12:35.640] but it's definitely going to be weaved into everything,

[00:12:35.640 - 00:12:39.200] which unless I would, there was some wild,

[00:12:39.200 - 00:12:40.560] something wildly off.

[00:12:40.560 - 00:12:45.080] That was why this AWG was stood up was because it's time

[00:12:45.080 - 00:12:47.760] to get all the structures and focuses.

[00:12:47.760 - 00:12:49.880] One thing I sort of realized through this all just because

[00:12:49.880 - 00:12:53.200] that they're, I think we're mixing up ontology questions.

[00:12:53.200 - 00:12:54.040] Yeah.

[00:12:54.040 - 00:12:57.000] Which are like, which is ontology is going to be a bit hard

[00:12:57.000 - 00:12:59.640] because I don't know how many sort of engineering related

[00:12:59.640 - 00:13:00.840] ontologies there are.

[00:13:00.840 - 00:13:02.120] Maybe it's not going to be hard actually.

[00:13:02.120 - 00:13:02.960] I don't know.

[00:13:02.960 - 00:13:03.480] No.

[00:13:03.480 - 00:13:05.680] I haven't looked into like standard ontologies

[00:13:05.680 - 00:13:07.320] beyond life sciences.

[00:13:07.320 - 00:13:11.200] And then, and that's different than I think what I raised last time

[00:13:11.200 - 00:13:15.360] of what we call configurations.

[00:13:15.360 - 00:13:18.160] Sort of what like Aaron was talking about of like,

[00:13:18.160 - 00:13:23.160] if you report data, if you have a column that's age,

[00:13:24.200 - 00:13:27.080] that should, and that's in number of years,

[00:13:27.080 - 00:13:30.600] that should always be a numerical number, right,

[00:13:30.600 - 00:13:33.000] versus like, and so, or,

[00:13:33.000 - 00:13:34.920] it's sort of what George was talking about,

[00:13:34.920 - 00:13:37.440] the configuration for the data formats,

[00:13:37.440 - 00:13:42.440] so that if this device always pushes out, I don't know,

[00:13:44.080 - 00:13:48.200] movie files, dot, move that there's a standard,

[00:13:48.200 - 00:13:50.560] because eventually we're going to want hardware data

[00:13:50.560 - 00:13:52.760] to be comparable, but if you don't have these sort of

[00:13:52.760 - 00:13:56.120] configuration standards for when a hardware data set

[00:13:56.120 - 00:13:58.000] isn't just that it made public,

[00:13:58.000 - 00:14:00.680] then it's going to be hard to do meta-analysis later.

[00:14:00.680 - 00:14:02.920] And I'm now sort of realizing that ontology

[00:14:02.920 - 00:14:06.840] and these configurations for the formatting standards

[00:14:06.840 - 00:14:10.120] are really two different things to really expedite

[00:14:10.120 - 00:14:12.720] the usage on the users end.

[00:14:12.720 - 00:14:15.440] Is this the whole purpose of configurations?

[00:14:15.440 - 00:14:17.440] So, but I think until the day I didn't realize

[00:14:17.440 - 00:14:20.600] that there were two different things really hanging up.

[00:14:20.600 - 00:14:22.880] Yeah, go ahead, Aaron.

[00:14:22.880 - 00:14:26.280] I think when we look through the tech port data,

[00:14:26.280 - 00:14:28.800] there's only like, there's a lot of entries,

[00:14:28.800 - 00:14:31.520] but generally they fall into certain categories.

[00:14:31.520 - 00:14:35.480] Like diagnostics will report readouts, right?

[00:14:35.480 - 00:14:39.840] And therefore you generally get time series data, right?

[00:14:39.840 - 00:14:41.480] So you can make assumptions on this.

[00:14:41.480 - 00:14:43.880] I think the thing that would be really, really sexy

[00:14:43.880 - 00:14:45.840] and really, really cool, I've said this before,

[00:14:45.840 - 00:14:47.240] and I'll say it again, I'm going to keep saying it

[00:14:47.240 - 00:14:48.960] until I'm really asked to not say it,

[00:14:48.960 - 00:14:53.800] is the, it's less ontological and more hardware

[00:14:53.800 - 00:14:58.880] CAD files, so like all CAD files on every CAD program

[00:14:58.880 - 00:15:01.040] compile to step.

[00:15:01.040 - 00:15:04.800] Yeah, the best ones, all the solid works ones,

[00:15:04.800 - 00:15:07.440] the Rhino files, like they will all compile

[00:15:07.440 - 00:15:09.640] to steps or assemblies.

[00:15:09.640 - 00:15:13.200] And there's a lot of really nice shape calculations

[00:15:13.200 - 00:15:16.000] that can be done from these downstream.

[00:15:16.000 - 00:15:17.640] And you can start playing with, you know,

[00:15:17.640 - 00:15:21.680] like, sort of like building models on top of the data.

[00:15:21.680 - 00:15:24.680] And so it's less ontological and more,

[00:15:24.680 - 00:15:29.200] I have a technology, will it fit in a place in space,

[00:15:29.200 - 00:15:31.800] in space, in space in space?

[00:15:31.800 - 00:15:32.720] Right?

[00:15:32.720 - 00:15:35.400] And I think that's where this system is really powerful.

[00:15:35.400 - 00:15:41.240] So it's less ontological and more physically located.

[00:15:41.240 - 00:15:44.760] That's my, that's my comment.

[00:15:44.760 - 00:15:45.280] Yeah.

[00:15:45.280 - 00:15:47.200] All these will come from the data,

[00:15:47.200 - 00:15:50.040] will come from whatever data you would categorize.

[00:15:50.040 - 00:15:52.280] That's really interesting.

[00:15:52.280 - 00:15:53.960] So when I had thought about Entology,

[00:15:53.960 - 00:15:57.240] it really was for categorizing like,

[00:15:57.240 - 00:16:02.680] what is this instrument, mostly in terms of what it does.

[00:16:02.960 - 00:16:05.960] But maybe also partly in terms of the shape and size

[00:16:05.960 - 00:16:09.320] and where it can go and that kind of thing.

[00:16:09.320 - 00:16:12.680] But, you know, a large part of that would be functional.

[00:16:12.680 - 00:16:15.640] I was talking, and it dance here, maybe he can chime in,

[00:16:15.640 - 00:16:17.760] but like, I was talking with Jack about this earlier this week.

[00:16:17.760 - 00:16:21.040] And he's, he sort of talked me out of this effort

[00:16:21.040 - 00:16:23.480] in just in that it could go on for very long time

[00:16:23.480 - 00:16:24.320] if we try to do this.

[00:16:24.320 - 00:16:27.240] And I'm, I'm actually, I'd love to hear if anyone thinks

[00:16:27.240 - 00:16:31.120] that a structured categorization,

[00:16:31.120 - 00:16:34.760] this really would just be for categorizing space flight hardware

[00:16:34.760 - 00:16:39.040] and organizing the, the types of hardware

[00:16:39.040 - 00:16:41.800] into, you know, their relationships.

[00:16:41.800 - 00:16:43.880] Whether that's even a useful thing,

[00:16:43.880 - 00:16:45.720] because it could be a way to spend a lot of time

[00:16:45.720 - 00:16:49.600] on something that is not the most useful part of this database.

[00:16:49.600 - 00:16:53.000] And perhaps we spend more time on, you know,

[00:16:53.000 - 00:16:55.800] getting the, getting the word out there in the manuscript,

[00:16:55.800 - 00:16:58.360] figuring, I think maybe a third, a second,

[00:16:58.400 - 00:16:59.800] it sounds like it's from this group,

[00:16:59.800 - 00:17:03.240] a second, you know, subgroup project could be,

[00:17:03.240 - 00:17:06.680] have to do with, with the, you know,

[00:17:06.680 - 00:17:10.640] the, the usability of the data,

[00:17:10.640 - 00:17:13.680] like the formatting of the, of the data.

[00:17:15.080 - 00:17:18.120] And then, and then third, you know,

[00:17:18.120 - 00:17:21.000] to get some folks who are interested in being specialist

[00:17:21.000 - 00:17:24.600] in certain groups and just adopting those groups.

[00:17:25.600 - 00:17:27.280] And, thoughts on that?

[00:17:27.280 - 00:17:30.080] Does anyone want to advocate for, I kind of want to,

[00:17:30.080 - 00:17:32.040] I'm likely to cross this off.

[00:17:32.040 - 00:17:33.960] Does anyone thinks that it's important?

[00:17:38.080 - 00:17:39.040] Okay.

[00:17:39.040 - 00:17:40.640] Jessica, this is Dan.

[00:17:41.640 - 00:17:45.200] Yeah, I think you definitely want to get down to the instance level,

[00:17:45.200 - 00:17:48.160] with the data level for these hardware pieces.

[00:17:48.160 - 00:17:51.680] And if you're going to do all this work at an,

[00:17:51.680 - 00:17:56.000] an ontology level, often times you're not putting in instances

[00:17:56.000 - 00:17:59.200] or the data level stuff into the ontology,

[00:17:59.200 - 00:18:02.400] unless it's a one of a kind thing, you know.

[00:18:03.920 - 00:18:07.480] So, I think you, you should look at like how much of this

[00:18:07.480 - 00:18:11.760] hardware is common across many different instances

[00:18:11.760 - 00:18:16.760] and ontology would really serve the needs that well

[00:18:17.000 - 00:18:19.280] versus how much are one of a kind

[00:18:19.280 - 00:18:21.320] and maybe you want to put them into an ontology,

[00:18:21.320 - 00:18:25.880] but that's my thought on that.

[00:18:25.880 - 00:18:28.320] Actually, I'm not, maybe I'm not fully sure I understand that.

[00:18:28.320 - 00:18:33.320] So, how many of these instruments are one of a kind versus?

[00:18:34.680 - 00:18:39.600] Yeah, so, Jack can talk a little bit about this more,

[00:18:39.600 - 00:18:43.440] but you know, when we, we do have things like, you know,

[00:18:43.440 - 00:18:48.280] NSRL particles accelerators in the RBO,

[00:18:48.280 - 00:18:51.000] but because they're one of a kind,

[00:18:51.000 - 00:18:54.080] and so we don't make a class for those things.

[00:18:54.080 - 00:18:56.960] We, for instance, of particle accelerators

[00:18:56.960 - 00:19:00.280] and put them in and characterize them in the ontology that way.

[00:19:00.280 - 00:19:03.640] But I don't know how many of your, all your data

[00:19:04.640 - 00:19:08.960] is going to be, you know, have these common,

[00:19:08.960 - 00:19:12.640] commonalities to, we're doing class modeling

[00:19:12.640 - 00:19:17.640] is valuable versus having individual unique things

[00:19:17.680 - 00:19:20.880] where, you know, then you could put those unique things

[00:19:20.880 - 00:19:26.880] into an ontology, but I don't know that I have a sense

[00:19:27.000 - 00:19:30.480] of your total scope of that split.

[00:19:30.480 - 00:19:35.480] Yeah, and this, that I think would, I think it would be a deep dive,

[00:19:36.800 - 00:19:39.280] I think it would be for me to understand quite a lot more

[00:19:39.280 - 00:19:44.280] about how to, yeah, I think, yeah, thanks, Dan,

[00:19:44.960 - 00:19:48.040] yeah, thanks, Dan, that makes,

[00:19:48.040 - 00:19:50.560] that helps put things in perspective a bit,

[00:19:50.560 - 00:19:52.600] that how much more discussed.

[00:19:52.600 - 00:19:53.400] Go ahead, Aaron.

[00:19:54.440 - 00:19:57.080] From what I've seen from the tech core data is,

[00:19:57.080 - 00:19:59.440] they mostly fall into pretty,

[00:19:59.440 - 00:20:01.560] pretty standard categories, right?

[00:20:01.560 - 00:20:03.920] There's sensors that sense things,

[00:20:03.920 - 00:20:06.920] and so the data will be like times series,

[00:20:06.920 - 00:20:11.200] or there are, you know, or it'll be something like growth chambers,

[00:20:11.200 - 00:20:16.200] which is more niche, but their output is crop, right?

[00:20:16.200 - 00:20:20.360] Crop water, you know, they have pretty standard ins and outs, right?

[00:20:20.360 - 00:20:21.840] You know, if it's an Eclist tech,

[00:20:21.840 - 00:20:25.160] it's taking in some waste and producing some,

[00:20:25.160 - 00:20:29.160] you know, removed waste or processed puck,

[00:20:29.160 - 00:20:32.080] or whatever, you know, poop or pee or whatever, right?

[00:20:32.080 - 00:20:36.000] So I think those, like, the particle accelerators

[00:20:36.000 - 00:20:38.440] would be the rare ones, and I don't know,

[00:20:38.440 - 00:20:40.920] I didn't think that would be in this list.

[00:20:40.920 - 00:20:41.960] No, yeah.

[00:20:41.960 - 00:20:43.840] I think there's something interesting though,

[00:20:43.840 - 00:20:45.000] to be said about different,

[00:20:45.000 - 00:20:47.560] like you can have a growth chamber on ISS,

[00:20:47.560 - 00:20:49.480] that's interfaces with ISS,

[00:20:49.480 - 00:20:52.640] you can also have a growth chamber that is a small sat,

[00:20:52.640 - 00:20:54.320] and does it go into the small sat's category,

[00:20:54.320 - 00:20:56.840] or does it go into the growth chamber or category?

[00:20:56.840 - 00:21:00.520] And if it grows, mice versus it grows plants, you know?

[00:21:00.520 - 00:21:04.160] So I think there's, that has been what has,

[00:21:04.160 - 00:21:05.760] we have been struggling with when,

[00:21:05.760 - 00:21:09.280] essentially this is because we have one field that is category,

[00:21:09.280 - 00:21:11.200] and the question is, what do you put there?

[00:21:11.200 - 00:21:14.840] Could we make that one field be more useful to people,

[00:21:16.200 - 00:21:20.440] and describe more things about what an instrument is and does?

[00:21:22.840 - 00:21:26.160] But it might be an exercise in,

[00:21:27.120 - 00:21:30.720] in structuring knowledge that is not as useful

[00:21:30.720 - 00:21:34.360] as some of the other things that we can work on with this database,

[00:21:34.360 - 00:21:37.720] is my current thought.

[00:21:39.840 - 00:21:42.440] You don't want to separate what is a growth chamber

[00:21:42.440 - 00:21:45.680] and what goes, and what is like a small satellite, right?

[00:21:45.680 - 00:21:49.200] So like small satellite versus ISS rack,

[00:21:50.040 - 00:21:53.040] those are like a rack would be equivalent

[00:21:53.040 - 00:21:57.800] to whatever caging unit you have in a small and a CubeSat, right?

[00:21:57.800 - 00:22:01.960] So you have three different categories of items here,

[00:22:01.960 - 00:22:03.440] am I misunderstanding this?

[00:22:03.440 - 00:22:06.840] So you have whatever flies,

[00:22:06.840 - 00:22:09.400] whatever you put in the flight hardware

[00:22:09.400 - 00:22:12.120] to stabilize an experimental apparatus,

[00:22:12.120 - 00:22:14.640] and then you have your experimental apparatus.

[00:22:15.480 - 00:22:18.160] Yeah, and we have for instance,

[00:22:18.160 - 00:22:21.680] struggled for small sats to whether to put the whole small

[00:22:21.680 - 00:22:24.440] set in there as an item or just the payload.

[00:22:24.440 - 00:22:27.040] And in what situations can you separate out the payload

[00:22:27.040 - 00:22:28.840] from the small satellite, right?

[00:22:28.840 - 00:22:32.880] I think we have some entries where it's the whole small

[00:22:32.880 - 00:22:35.040] satellite is in the database.

[00:22:37.120 - 00:22:39.600] And if you separate them out,

[00:22:39.600 - 00:22:43.280] do you also, if you just put the payload of the small satellite,

[00:22:43.280 - 00:22:47.320] do you then also have an entry for the spacecraft

[00:22:47.320 - 00:22:49.280] or not?

[00:22:49.280 - 00:22:50.440] Tony.

[00:22:51.600 - 00:22:52.440] Yeah.

[00:22:52.440 - 00:22:54.280] Exactly, right person's hot about this.

[00:22:54.280 - 00:22:57.600] I'm sorry, sorry, I was a bit late this morning,

[00:22:57.600 - 00:23:01.120] but yeah, I would say there's,

[00:23:01.120 - 00:23:04.600] I can't see a reason not to separate out the payload.

[00:23:04.600 - 00:23:07.120] When we develop and fly these things,

[00:23:07.120 - 00:23:10.480] the bus is very much distinct from the payload,

[00:23:10.480 - 00:23:12.280] and although there's team overlap,

[00:23:12.280 - 00:23:15.280] sort of different groups work on the bus and the payload.

[00:23:15.280 - 00:23:17.680] And the bus is everything is the spacecraft, you know,

[00:23:17.680 - 00:23:21.160] it's the one U version of the ISS.

[00:23:21.160 - 00:23:25.120] And then there's a two U payload, which is the instrument.

[00:23:25.120 - 00:23:28.600] So I don't see a reason in this particular database

[00:23:28.600 - 00:23:31.960] to include the small sat bus per se.

[00:23:32.920 - 00:23:34.640] Maybe someone else can think of a reason,

[00:23:34.640 - 00:23:36.640] but I think the CubeSat payloads, of course,

[00:23:36.640 - 00:23:39.040] are highly relevant because they can be reformatted

[00:23:39.040 - 00:23:42.480] to fly on almost any other platform as well,

[00:23:43.680 - 00:23:45.880] with sometimes with minimal modifications.

[00:23:45.880 - 00:23:48.800] So I think it's the payload that we want to focus on.

[00:23:48.800 - 00:23:49.800] Yeah.

[00:23:49.800 - 00:23:52.640] And I think that does will require us to revisit

[00:23:52.640 - 00:23:54.920] some of the small sat entries.

[00:23:54.920 - 00:23:55.760] True.

[00:23:55.760 - 00:23:58.000] You have a point because yeah, anyway,

[00:23:58.000 - 00:23:59.360] so that was just one example.

[00:23:59.360 - 00:24:00.360] Right.

[00:24:00.360 - 00:24:02.360] Some of the questions that have brought, you know,

[00:24:02.360 - 00:24:03.840] brought this up.

[00:24:03.840 - 00:24:06.560] And but it sounds as though, you know,

[00:24:06.560 - 00:24:08.440] I'm still leaning toward,

[00:24:08.440 - 00:24:10.920] let's, there may be other things for this group to focus on.

[00:24:10.920 - 00:24:13.560] And I know we have reached nine o'clock.

[00:24:13.560 - 00:24:16.280] So I'm able to stay for a few more minutes,

[00:24:16.280 - 00:24:19.000] if anyone wants to chat about putting their names down

[00:24:19.000 - 00:24:21.520] for some of these specific subgroup projects.

[00:24:21.520 - 00:24:25.720] And then I will also then post on the,

[00:24:25.720 - 00:24:28.000] on the forum space and send out some emails to get,

[00:24:28.000 - 00:24:30.200] recruit people for the subgroup projects.

[00:24:30.200 - 00:24:31.840] So I think it sounds like we're going to still have

[00:24:31.840 - 00:24:34.320] the manuscript adopted instrument group.

[00:24:34.320 - 00:24:37.520] And then, and then maybe something having to do with data,

[00:24:37.520 - 00:24:41.440] formatting usability and standardization.

[00:24:43.160 - 00:24:45.880] So here for anyone who wants to raise their hand

[00:24:45.880 - 00:24:49.240] to volunteer for things or chat for the last couple of minutes

[00:24:49.240 - 00:24:51.400] about any of these topics.

[00:24:51.400 - 00:24:52.440] Otherwise, thank you.

[00:24:52.440 - 00:24:53.840] Yes, Tony, go ahead.

[00:24:53.840 - 00:24:58.840] Okay, I will volunteer, Aaron said fluids.

[00:24:59.360 - 00:25:01.960] So first of all, I volunteer to help Aaron with fluids,

[00:25:01.960 - 00:25:05.680] but I was going to volunteer more generally

[00:25:05.680 - 00:25:10.680] for small payloads for chemistry and biology experiments.

[00:25:10.680 - 00:25:11.560] Mm-hmm.

[00:25:11.560 - 00:25:12.760] Okay.

[00:25:12.760 - 00:25:16.600] Small, maybe, should I say small automated payloads?

[00:25:16.600 - 00:25:18.960] In other words, you know, the stuff that I know best,

[00:25:18.960 - 00:25:20.400] and I think I can be most helpful with,

[00:25:20.400 - 00:25:22.880] or the payloads that operate themselves,

[00:25:22.880 - 00:25:25.120] the ones that are operated by crew,

[00:25:25.120 - 00:25:29.800] I have pretty minimal experience with the knowledge of.

[00:25:29.800 - 00:25:30.720] Okay.

[00:25:30.720 - 00:25:31.720] Thank you, Tony.

[00:25:31.720 - 00:25:33.160] That makes perfect sense.

[00:25:39.280 - 00:25:42.080] And if anyone else is, yes, just go.

[00:25:43.040 - 00:25:46.040] Hi, yes, I'm really speeding.

[00:25:46.040 - 00:25:46.880] I think so.

[00:25:46.880 - 00:25:51.440] There's three parts that we have to focus on.

[00:25:51.440 - 00:25:54.040] One of the first is the data standards,

[00:25:54.040 - 00:25:55.600] because I think it's really essential

[00:25:55.600 - 00:25:57.480] on some sort of way.

[00:25:57.480 - 00:26:01.040] The second one, I think, when we talk about ontology,

[00:26:01.040 - 00:26:02.240] I think it's also important,

[00:26:02.240 - 00:26:05.360] because when we have to plan

[00:26:05.360 - 00:26:08.200] or to design some new instruments,

[00:26:08.200 - 00:26:10.080] it's also important to categorize it

[00:26:10.080 - 00:26:11.960] and to understand what to put,

[00:26:11.960 - 00:26:15.720] what to insert, you know, the physical dimension

[00:26:15.720 - 00:26:20.720] and all the space that they have to have inside the tool.

[00:26:22.400 - 00:26:25.720] And one thing I was thinking about it,

[00:26:25.720 - 00:26:30.280] so is that possible also to insert in the data sets?

[00:26:30.280 - 00:26:34.400] Some sort of integration with AI about the analysis

[00:26:34.400 - 00:26:37.480] or the integration of the data sets.

[00:26:39.640 - 00:26:42.080] So AI based analysis?

[00:26:43.320 - 00:26:47.280] Yeah, because I think sometimes it's most easiest,

[00:26:47.280 - 00:26:50.280] you know, to interrogate just the data sets

[00:26:50.280 - 00:26:52.920] in a sort of discussion,

[00:26:52.920 - 00:26:56.200] and not just to compile the data sets

[00:26:56.200 - 00:26:59.320] and understand what data they give me back

[00:26:59.320 - 00:27:01.360] and make the comparison.

[00:27:01.360 - 00:27:05.040] I think this can also be made by AI itself, the comparison,

[00:27:05.040 - 00:27:10.040] and also if that's tools fits in what I need.

[00:27:13.320 - 00:27:14.160] Absolutely.

[00:27:14.160 - 00:27:16.120] So Francesca, I then, I will look,

[00:27:16.120 - 00:27:17.840] I'll count who's part of,

[00:27:17.840 - 00:27:20.520] so the journal manuscript will be partly around

[00:27:20.520 - 00:27:22.560] just writing the thing and getting it out there,

[00:27:22.560 - 00:27:26.240] but then also about potential analyses

[00:27:26.240 - 00:27:27.640] that might be incorporated.

[00:27:27.640 - 00:27:29.840] And so I think I'm gonna, I understand

[00:27:29.840 - 00:27:31.280] you're interested in data standards

[00:27:31.280 - 00:27:33.720] and then also in potentially doing an analysis

[00:27:33.720 - 00:27:37.240] and we'll see where that goes.

[00:27:37.240 - 00:27:38.240] Yeah.

[00:27:38.240 - 00:27:39.080] Yeah.

[00:27:39.080 - 00:27:40.080] Okay, thank you.

[00:27:40.080 - 00:27:40.920] George.

[00:27:42.680 - 00:27:45.480] I think this may be too much of an ask,

[00:27:46.240 - 00:27:48.960] given that you have the different hardware,

[00:27:48.960 - 00:27:50.840] and I don't know how feasibility,

[00:27:50.840 - 00:27:54.440] it would be good to have actually some pull data

[00:27:54.440 - 00:27:58.480] that has been generated from those hardware.

[00:27:58.480 - 00:28:03.080] And then that way, you know, we can figure out

[00:28:03.080 - 00:28:06.160] which software can actually be used to analyze

[00:28:06.160 - 00:28:10.080] the set data once that's actually obtained.

[00:28:10.080 - 00:28:13.360] Now, some of that data will be available

[00:28:13.360 - 00:28:16.520] in the database already as part of the data

[00:28:16.520 - 00:28:18.280] that was generated by the missions,

[00:28:18.280 - 00:28:22.760] but I don't know, Brian probably knows what's out there more.

[00:28:22.760 - 00:28:25.920] But I think it's important to have like what the

[00:28:25.920 - 00:28:29.880] standard output would be from these machines,

[00:28:29.880 - 00:28:32.880] this hardware, whatever comes out, you know,

[00:28:32.880 - 00:28:36.000] if it's sequencing, it might be a pod five file

[00:28:36.000 - 00:28:40.120] or it's a little text file that has some tracks

[00:28:40.120 - 00:28:43.320] or if it's an XML file,

[00:28:43.320 - 00:28:47.760] and then we need the breakdown of what those terms mean.

[00:28:47.760 - 00:28:49.080] So, yeah.

[00:28:49.080 - 00:28:52.880] And this is important in connecting the data

[00:28:52.880 - 00:28:56.880] to the analysis and anything downstream from there.

[00:28:56.880 - 00:28:57.720] I think.

[00:28:57.720 - 00:28:58.560] Yes.

[00:28:58.560 - 00:29:01.320] So this is, and I know that Aaron has previous talk about,

[00:29:01.320 - 00:29:03.880] oh, can we get folks to upload CAD files?

[00:29:03.880 - 00:29:05.920] I could believe, so I think we could have this list

[00:29:05.920 - 00:29:08.200] of other things, which might be in the future,

[00:29:08.200 - 00:29:12.160] implemented fields where providers of Hardware

[00:29:12.160 - 00:29:15.200] have the option of adding other attachments

[00:29:15.200 - 00:29:18.120] to their Hardware entry, which could be design files,

[00:29:18.120 - 00:29:21.400] could be sample data, could be things like that, right?

[00:29:21.400 - 00:29:24.040] And I think it will be hard to require

[00:29:24.040 - 00:29:26.080] that all entries have that, but absolutely,

[00:29:26.080 - 00:29:28.760] I think we can add it as a really useful thing

[00:29:28.760 - 00:29:31.280] that we can encourage folks to contribute.

[00:29:31.280 - 00:29:33.240] Yeah.

[00:29:33.240 - 00:29:34.080] OK.

[00:29:34.360 - 00:29:39.080] Are there any last comments anyone else

[00:29:39.080 - 00:29:42.040] who wants to volunteer for things?

[00:29:42.040 - 00:29:43.040] OK.

[00:29:43.040 - 00:29:47.640] I'll put, see, I've got some things in the chat.

[00:29:47.640 - 00:29:48.280] Great.

[00:29:48.280 - 00:29:48.800] OK.

[00:29:48.800 - 00:29:49.800] Thank you.

[00:29:49.800 - 00:29:50.800] But.

[00:29:50.800 - 00:29:57.800] OK.

[00:29:57.800 - 00:30:07.000] OK.

[00:30:07.000 - 00:30:09.920] And absent any other comments, then I

[00:30:09.920 - 00:30:12.360] do want to be respectful of your time.

[00:30:12.360 - 00:30:15.000] And I really, really appreciate everyone's participation

[00:30:15.000 - 00:30:15.600] today.

[00:30:15.600 - 00:30:18.040] I will send out more advance news

[00:30:18.040 - 00:30:22.840] before our next meeting will set up a standing monthly meeting.

[00:30:22.840 - 00:30:26.880] And for those of you who are interested in these small projects,

[00:30:26.880 - 00:30:28.240] we'll start getting engaged soon.

[00:30:32.280 - 00:30:34.280] Ryan, anything else?

[00:30:34.280 - 00:30:35.320] No, that's great.

[00:30:35.320 - 00:30:36.160] OK.

[00:30:36.160 - 00:30:37.960] I'm going to take a little bit of time.

[00:30:37.960 - 00:30:38.960] Yeah.

[00:30:38.960 - 00:30:40.440] It's.

[00:30:40.440 - 00:30:40.960] Yeah.

[00:30:44.000 - 00:30:45.760] OK.
