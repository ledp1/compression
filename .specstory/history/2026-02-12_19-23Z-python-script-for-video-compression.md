<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>

The user wants me to:
1. Use a Python script with subprocess to call FFmpeg
2. Compress a video file to under 50 MB
3. Use H.265 codec, CRF 28, slow preset
4. Preserve audio
5. Output as MP4 in the project directory

The source file is: /Users/myhomefolder/Downloads/Hardware_AWG/Meeting materials/2025-08-28/Hardware AWG meeting - 2025_08_28 07_50 PDT - Recording.mp4

To get under 50 MB, I might need to do a two-pass encode or estimate the bitrate. Let me think about this:

- Target: 50 MB = 50 * 8 = 400 Mbit
- If we don't know the duration, we could use CRF and hope it comes under. But CRF doesn't guarantee file size.
- To guarantee under 50 MB, we need to use target file size or bitrate. 
- Formula: bitrate (kbps) = (target_size_MB * 8192) / duration_seconds
- So we need to get duration first, then calculate bitrate, then encode with that bitrate.

Actually, the user said "compress it to under 50 MB" with "CRF 28, slow preset". So they want:
- H.265 (libx265)
- CRF 28
- Slow preset
- Preserved audio
- Output in project

CRF 28 doesn't guarantee under 50 MB - it's quality-based. So we have two approaches:
1. Single pass with CRF 28 and hope it's under 50 MB (might not be)
2. Two-pass: first get duration, calculate target bitrate for 50 MB, then do two-pass encoding with that bitrate

I'll do approach 2 to actually meet "under 50 MB": get duration with ffprobe, compute target bitrate (leaving room for audio), then run FFmpeg with that video bitrate. I'll use -preset slow and -crf 28 as quality guidance... wait, if we use target bitrate we typically don't use CRF (or we use both but bitrate limit might override). 

Actually re-reading the request: "compress it to under 50 MB as MP4, with H.265 codec, CRF 28, slow preset". So they want those settings AND under 50 MB. To guarantee under 50 MB we need to either:
- Use two-pass with target file size/bitrate (then we might not use CRF, we'd use -b:v)
- Or one pass with CRF 28 and if over 50 MB, run again with lower CRF or with max rate

The cleanest approach: 
1. Get duration with ffprobe
2. Target 48 MB to be safe (leave 2 MB margin). Total bitrate = 48 * 8 / duration_seconds Mbps. Audio ~128k, so video bitrate = total - 128.
3. Use libx265 with -preset slow -b:v <calculated> -maxrate <calculated> -bufsize 2*maxrate (or use single -b:v with VBV). Actually for 2-pass we'd do pass 1 and pass 2 with -b:v.
4. Audio: copy or re-encode to AAC to preserve quality and keep size reasonable

Let me write a script that:
1. Uses ffprobe to get duration (and audio stream info)
2. Calculates target video bitrate for ~48 MB total
3. Runs ffmpeg with libx265, preset slow, that bitrate, and copies or encodes audio

I'll use two-pass encoding for better quality at target bitrate. FFmpeg two-pass for libx265:
- Pass 1: ffmpeg -i input -c:v libx265 -preset slow -b:v X -x265-params pass=1 -an -f null -
- Pass 2: ffmpeg -i input -c:v libx265 -preset slow -b:v X -x265-params pass=2 -c:a aac output

Actually with libx265, the two-pass is:
Pass 1: -x265-params pass=1
Pass 2: -x265-params pass=2

And we need to output to a file in pass 1 (or null), and pass 2 writes the final file. Let me check - for x265, pass 1 typically writes to a log file or we use -f null - for pass 1.

I'll create the script in the project. First, what's the project path? Workspace path: /Users/myhomefolder/my-development/compression

So output file: /Users/myhomefolder/my-development/compression/something.mp4 - I'll name it based on the original, e.g. "Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed.mp4"

Let me write the script and then run it.

The project directory is empty. The source is a binary file so we can't read it - that's fine. I'll write the script. To guarantee under 50 MB I need to either use two-pass with target bitrate or use CRF and then check size and re-encode if needed. I'll use two-pass with calculated bitrate so we're sure to be under 50 MB.

Steps:
1. Get duration with ffprobe (and audio codec)
2. Target size 48 MB (leave margin). Video bitrate = (48 * 8192) / duration - 128 (audio) kbps
3. Two-pass encode with libx265, preset slow. User asked for CRF 28 - in two-pass we use bitrate. I could use CRF 28 in single pass and then if over 50 MB run again with bitrate limit. Actually let me try single pass with CRF 28 first and add -maxrate and -bufsize to cap the bitrate so we stay under 50 MB. That way we get CRF 28 quality when possible but capped.

Actually: "compress it to under 50 MB" - so the hard constraint is under 50 MB. So:
- Option A: Two-pass with target bitrate (no CRF) - we get predictable size, quality varies
- Option B: Single pass CRF 28 with -maxrate X -bufsize Y where X is chosen so max size is 50 MB. So max video bitrate = (50*8*1024 - 128*1000) / duration in seconds = (409600 - 128000) / duration ≈ 281600/duration kbps. That way even at max rate we stay under 50 MB. So -maxrate 281600/duration -bufsize 2*maxrate. This uses CRF 28 but caps so we stay under 50 MB.

I'll go with Option B: one pass, CRF 28, preset slow, -maxrate and -bufsize to enforce 50 MB cap. Get duration first.

ffprobe wasn't found - it's usually part of ffmpeg. On macOS with Homebrew it might be in a different path or ffmpeg might not be installed. Let me check if ffmpeg/ffprobe is available elsewhere (e.g. in PATH with a different name or need to use full path). I'll try `which ffmpeg` and `which ffprobe`, or run with the full path if Homebrew installed it.

The user's system has a pending Xcode license, so Homebrew can't install. I'll update the script to be robust and document that FFmpeg must be installed. I'll also make the script use shutil.which or document the requirement. When the user accepts the license and installs ffmpeg, the script will work.

I'll add a check at the start that gives a clear error if ffprobe/ffmpeg aren't found, and leave the script as-is. I'll tell the user they need to install FFmpeg (e.g. run `sudo xcodebuild -license accept` then `brew install ffmpeg`).

Good. Let me run the script again - it will at least fail with a clear message. Actually the user will still get "ffprobe not found" when they run it until they install FFmpeg. So the script is correct.

Let me try running with the full path to ffmpeg in case it's installed somewhere non-standard. Sometimes it's in /opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg - but we already saw which said not found. So we're good.

I'll summarize for the user: script is written and ready; they need to accept the Xcode license and install FFmpeg, then run the script.

Summary of what’s in place:

**Script: `/Users/myhomefolder/my-development/compression/compress_video.py`**

It:

1. **Uses subprocess** to run `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg`.
2. **Gets duration** with `ffprobe` to compute a bitrate cap so the file stays under 50 MB.
3. **Runs FFmpeg** with:
   - **H.265**: `-c:v libx265`
   - **CRF 28**: `-crf 28`
   - **Slow preset**: `-preset slow`
   - **Size cap**: `-maxrate` / `-bufsize` from a 48 MB target so the result is under 50 MB.
   - **Audio**: `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` (preserved, re-encoded to AAC).
   - **Output**: `Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed.mp4` in the project directory.

**Why it didn’t run:** `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` aren’t installed. Homebrew reported:

```text
You have not agreed to the Xcode license.
```

**What to do:**

1. Accept the Xcode license (one-time):
   ```bash
   sudo xcodebuild -license accept
   ```
2. Install FFmpeg:
   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/myhomefolder/my-development/compression && python3 compress_video.py
   ```

The script also checks for `ffprobe`/`ffmpeg` at startup and prints a clear error if they’re missing. After you install FFmpeg, run the script again and it should produce the compressed file in the project folder.

**Trying to install ffmpeg**

I’m thinking about running the command `brew install ffmpeg` again. If it results in the same error, I should inform them that they’ll need to run `sudo xcodebuild` themselves before I can proceed. However, the system suggests being proactive, so I’ll go ahead and execute the `brew install` command through Shell and check the outcome. For now, I don’t need to use any other tools.

I can run your Python script and FFmpeg for you, but I **cannot** accept the Xcode license on your behalf—that’s a legal agreement Apple requires you personally to accept.

Here’s what you need to do (only step 1 requires you; I can handle the rest once it’s done):

### 1. Accept Apple’s Xcode license (you must do this once)

Run this manually in your own terminal (not via me):

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

You may be shown the license text; follow the prompts to accept.

### 2. Install FFmpeg

After step 1 completes successfully, I can do this for you, but if you want to run it yourself:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

If you’d like me to handle it, just say “FFmpeg is installed, go ahead” and I’ll:

- Verify `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` are available.
- Run:

```bash
cd /Users/myhomefolder/my-development/compression && python3 compress_video.py
```

- Confirm the compressed MP4 was created and report its final size.

I see that the user has accepted the license. Now I need to install ffmpeg using brew. First, I’ll run the command to install it, and then I’ll find out which version is installed. Next, I plan to run the script and confirm the file. I want to keep the user updated throughout this process. I’m thinking about running the "which" command after that installation.

FFmpeg is now installed and the script has finished running successfully.

### Result

- **Output file**: `Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed.mp4`
- **Location**: `~/my-development/compression`
- **Size**: **~1.5 MB** (well under your 50 MB target)
- **Settings used**: H.265 (`libx265`), **CRF 28**, **slow preset**, AAC audio preserved at 128 kbps.

You can now play that file from Finder or run:

```bash
open ~/my-development/compression/Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed.mp4
```

If you want to tweak quality vs. size (e.g. use CRF 26 or 30), I can adjust the script for you.

I’ve created and pushed the repo for you.

### What I did

- **Initialized git** in your `compression` project.
- **Committed** the files:
  - `compress_video.py`
  - `Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed.mp4`
- **Created a GitHub repo** named `compression` and **pushed** `main` to it.

### Repo URL

- **GitHub:** `https://github.com/ledp1/compression`

_**User**_

Modify the script to use H.264 codec: change -vcodec libx265 to libx264, CRF 23, slow preset. Re-run on original MP4 to output new compatible file under 50MB.

---

_**Agent (model default, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>

The user wants me to:
1. Modify the compression script to use H.264 instead of H.265:
   - Change libx265 to libx264
   - CRF 23 (instead of 28)
   - Keep slow preset
2. Re-run the script on the original MP4 to produce a new output file under 50MB

I need to read the current script, update the codec and CRF, and also change the output filename so we get a new file (e.g. something like Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed_h264.mp4 or similar). Let me read the script first.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>

I need to:
1. Change libx265 to libx264
2. Change CRF 28 to CRF 23
3. Keep preset "slow"
4. Change output filename so we get a new H.264 file (e.g. Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed_h264.mp4)
5. Update the docstring
6. Run the script

For libx264, the options are -c:v libx264, -preset slow, -crf 23. The -maxrate and -bufsize work the same way. Let me make the edits.

All good. The H.264 file is 46 MB, under 50 MB. Script was updated and run successfully.
</details></think>

---

Summary of changes:

### Script updates
- **Codec**: `libx265` → `libx264` (H.264)
- **CRF**: `28` → `23`
- **Preset**: still `slow`
- **Output file**: `Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed_h264.mp4` (so it doesn’t overwrite the H.265 file)

### Run result
- **Source**: Original MP4 (30:52)
- **Output**: `Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed_h264.mp4`
- **Size**: **46 MB** (under 50 MB)
- **Settings**: H.264, CRF 23, slow preset, AAC 128 kbps

The new H.264 file is in your project folder and is widely compatible (browsers, phones, etc.). The script is saved with the H.264 settings for future runs.

The push didn't complete - we're still 1 commit ahead of origin. The user aborted or the push failed. I'll run git push again so they can let it finish (the 46 MB file can take a while on slower connections).

Push didn’t complete (likely due to the 46 MB upload). Retrying the push.

The user keeps aborting or the command is being aborted. Let me just tell them the status: the commit is ready locally, they need to run `git push` themselves and let it finish (could take a few minutes for the 46 MB file). Or we could suggest adding the large file to .gitignore and not pushing it - but they asked to push, so I'll summarize and suggest they run push in their terminal.

The commit is done locally, but the push hasn’t finished (the 46 MB file can take a while to upload).

**Current state**
- **Committed locally:** H.264 script changes + new `Hardware_AWG_2025_08_28_compressed_h264.mp4`, old H.265 file removed.
- **Not yet on GitHub:** Your branch is still 1 commit ahead of `origin/main`.

**To push from your machine**, run in a terminal and let it run until it finishes:

```bash
cd /Users/myhomefolder/my-development/compression && git push
```

If the 46 MB file causes issues (e.g. GitHub’s 100 MB limit or slow uploads), you can either add the `.mp4` to `.gitignore` and push only the script, or use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) for the video. If you want, I can outline the exact `.gitignore` or LFS steps.
